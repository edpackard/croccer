# Croccer

aka Croc-tober Fest II: The Snappening

A simple Frogger clone using vanilla JS, and the HTML 5 canvas.

No TDD here: the purpose of this project was to learn a bit more JS, especially using the canvas and working with a simple game engine. There is still plenty of refactoring to be done with the code, and it has become increasingly clear to me how I could build a simple game through a TDD approach.

This tutorial series was especially useful: https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/develop-a-html5-javascript-game

The keyboard input code came from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Control_mechanisms/Desktop_with_mouse_and_keyboard

## How to install this program

## How to play

Move your hapless swimmer with the arrow keys. You need to reach the top of the screen (river) without hitting a crocodile. Hitting a crocodile is an instant game over and your level count will be reset. As you progress through the levels, the crocs will speed up and occasionally change their patterns. This means at some point the game will become too fast to play, but I haven't reached that point yet!
